# Multimodal AI Evaluations

> **A practitioner's framework for testing AI products that see, hear, read, and speak.**

Built from applied evaluation practice on real multimodal AI products. Not theory — a working operational system with 22 production-ready templates, a complete governance layer, and evaluation reports across multiple products.

---

## The Problem This Solves

Text-only AI evaluation is hard. Multimodal AI evaluation is harder in one specific, dangerous way.

A confident, smooth, well-produced audio output **sounds trustworthy even when it is wrong.** A beautiful diagram **looks authoritative even when it misrepresents the data.** Production quality bypasses critical judgment before accuracy is assessed.

And the failure is usually invisible at the output — because approximately **34% of multimodal failures originate at the ingestion layer** (Stage 1 of 9), before the AI model has been involved at all. Evaluating only the final output means measuring symptoms, not causes.

This framework teaches you to find failures where they originate, not where they appear.

## The Five Quality Contracts

Multimodal AI products must be evaluated across five separate, independently failing contracts. A single accuracy score hides too much — always evaluate them separately.

| # | Contract | The Core Question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Ingestion Fidelity** | Did the pipeline faithfully extract what was in the source? |
| 2 | **Faithfulness** | Is the output traceable to the sources? |
| 3 | **Factuality** | Is the output correct about the real world? |
| 4 | **Cross-Modal Consistency** | Do the output modalities agree with each other? |
| 5 | **Output Quality** | Is the production quality adequate per medium? |

> **Ingestion Fidelity is the most commonly missed contract.** In text-only AI it can be folded into faithfulness. In multimodal AI — where PDFs drop figure captions, ASR hallucinates during silence, and retrievers ignore image-bearing chunks — it earns its own contract, its own evaluator, its own canary monitor, and a 15% floor in every test suite at every lifecycle stage.

> **Safety is a mandatory governance overlay** applied across all five contracts — not a sixth standalone contract. Every evaluation specification must include an adversarial safety test set regardless of which quality contracts are triggered.

---

## The Nine-Stage Pipeline

Every multimodal failure originates at a specific stage. This framework evaluates all nine.

```
Stage 1 — Ingestion       ← ~34% of all failures start here
Stage 2 — Normalization
Stage 3 — Indexing
Stage 4 — Retrieval
Stage 5 — Reasoning
Stage 6 — Generation
Stage 7 — Synthesis       ← ~18% of failures start here
Stage 8 — Guardrails
Stage 9 — Delivery        ← where most teams only evaluate
```

## The DECODE Translation Framework

**The gap between what stakeholders ask for and what evaluators measure is where quality programs fail.**

The DECODE framework is a six-step methodology for translating product requirements — PRDs, feature requests, stakeholder statements — into formal, executable multimodal evaluation specifications. It is the upstream discipline that feeds every template and evaluator in this repository.

```
D — Decompose requirements into atomic capability claims
E — Enumerate modalities and input slices
C — Classify by pipeline stage, quality contract, and failure mode
O — Operationalize each failure mode as a measurement primitive
D — Define thresholds, gates, datasets, and monitoring
E — Express as a formal Eval Specification
```

**Key artifacts the DECODE framework produces:**

- **Eval Stub** — a 7-section structured commitment that lives inside a PRD, authored by the PM in the same session as the feature requirement. Seeds the full Eval Spec without a separate translation meeting.
- **Eval Specification** — the full 15-section evaluation contract, authored by the eval engineer from the Eval Stub, governs all launch gate decisions.
- **PRD Eval Requirements Section** — the governance container embedded in every AI feature PRD that holds the Eval Stub, spec reference, and launch gate commitments.

The complete framework is documented in [`guides/multimodal-ai-evals-speak.md`](guides/multimodal-ai-evals-speak.md), with all four companion templates in `/templates`.

## The Backlog Priority Formula

An original contribution of this framework. Rewards upstream, high-blast-radius fixes over visible downstream symptoms.

```
Priority Score = (S × F × C × B × U) ÷ TTL

S   = Severity       High=3 · Medium=2 · Low=1
F   = Frequency      % of traces as decimal (15% = 0.15)
C   = Confidence     High=3 · Medium=2 · Low=1
B   = Blast Radius   Count of downstream failure tags resolved by one fix
U   = Upstream-ness  Ingestion=5 · Retrieval=4 · Generation=3 · Synthesis=2 · Delivery=1
TTL = Time to deploy in days
```

**Why Blast Radius changes everything:** A parser fix that resolves a dropped-caption failure simultaneously resolves downstream faithfulness breaks and TTS mispronunciations sitting in the same causal chain. Blast radius is why an ingestion fix almost always outranks a prompt engineering fix — even when the prompt fix deploys faster.

| Example Fix | S | F | C | TTL | B | U | Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Parser upgrade — drops captions | 3 | 0.15 | 3 | 3d | 3 | 5 | **6.75** |
| Pronunciation lexicon update | 2 | 0.12 | 3 | 1d | 1 | 2 | 1.44 |
| Cross-modal consistency check | 3 | 0.08 | 2 | 7d | 2 | 3 | 0.41 |

## Eval Test Case Distribution Across the Lifecycle

The distribution of your evaluation test cases should change as your product matures. Using the same eval mix in development, release, and production is a quiet mistake — it hides the wrong failures at the wrong time.

| Case Type | Development | Release (Gate) | Production |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Happy Paths | 15% | 35% | 45% |
| Edge Cases | 30% | 20% | 5% |
| **Ingestion Failures** | **25%** | **15% floor** | **15% floor** |
| Safety Cases | 15% | 15% | 10% |
| Regressions | 15% | 15% | 25% |
| **Suite size** | **40–80** | **60–300** | **100–500+** |
| **Primary purpose** | Discovery | Enforcement | Monitoring |

> **The ingestion floor never drops below 15% at any lifecycle stage.** Multimodal pipelines fail silently upstream. Your eval suite must be able to see it.

---

## The AMI Cycle

The evaluation discipline runs on three continuous phases:

```
ANALYZE ──► MEASURE ──► IMPROVE ──► (repeat)
   │              │            │
Surface Map    Quality       Driver Analysis
Error Analysis Contracts     Fix Surfaces
               Evaluators    Prioritization
               Monitoring
```

Each cycle tightens your taxonomy, improves your evaluators, and reduces the time between a failure appearing in production and a fix landing.

## Evaluation Maturity Model

Where is your team today?

| Level | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Ad Hoc | No taxonomy. Decisions made by whoever argues most confidently. |
| 2 | Instrumented | Logging live. At least one evaluator with documented kappa ≥ 0.70. |
| 3 | Systematic | All five contracts have evaluators. CI gate blocking. Written decision memos. |
| 4 | Closed Loop | Production failures feed the regression suite. Driver analysis is the default response to every alert. |
| 5 | Self-Improving | New failure modes are taxonomized and in the regression suite within one sprint of discovery. |

> **You have reached Level 5 when:** a new team member can pick up any failing eval, find its taxonomy tag, look up its causal chain, route it to the correct fix surface, apply the T-17 prioritization formula, and propose an evidence-backed intervention — all without asking anyone.

## Key Concepts

**Ingestion Fidelity** — The most commonly missed contract. ~34% of multimodal failures originate at the ingestion layer before the model sees anything.

**Blast Radius** — The number of downstream failure tags resolved by a single upstream fix. The most underweighted dimension in standard backlog prioritization.

**Causal Chain** — A sequence where one upstream failure causes multiple downstream failures. Fix the root; resolve the chain.

**Canary Corpus** — A fixed set of 20 documents with known ground truth, checked daily against the ingestion pipeline. Never refreshed — stability is what makes it useful.

**Zero-Tolerance Event** — A failure that triggers immediate rollback regardless of all other scores. Named before any evaluation runs, not after.

**Judge Drift** — When the AI model powering your evaluators is silently updated by its provider. Evaluators become more lenient; metrics look like they're improving when they're not. Caught by monthly kappa recalibration on 20 fresh labeled examples.

**Consumption Drift** — Same technical output quality, declining user engagement. A cluster of listeners dropping off at the same audio timestamp is a precision failure detector that no LLM judge can replicate.

**Specification Debt** — Evaluation criteria derived after the fact from complaints, regressions, and launch failures rather than from product requirements established before development begins. The DECODE framework exists to prevent this.

**Eval Stub** — A 7-section structured commitment authored by a PM during the PRD authoring session. Captures quality contracts triggered, modalities involved, top failure modes, P0 launch gate thresholds, high-risk slice, and out-of-scope conditions. Seeds the full Eval Specification without a separate translation meeting.

**DECODE** — The six-step translation methodology for converting product requirements into multimodal eval specifications: Decompose → Enumerate → Classify → Operationalize → Define → Express. The discipline that closes the gap between what a product says it does and what evaluation evidence can prove.
